# QR-App

The objetive is to make a mobile app that can read QR and bar codes and save them in a list.
When a code is scanned the user can give it a name for easy search in the list.
The QR list tab shows the user all the codes that have scanned, with namme, date scanned and link, and can press on each card wich redirects to that link. This view also has a search bar (controlled) to filter by name.

## Starting

1. In folder QR-app run:

```
npm install
```

2. Then, to start the proyect run:

```
expo start
```

if yo have troubles you can try ` $ expo start --tunnel`. It allows devices outside of your LAN to access the servers without you nedding to change your firewall settings.
The app is also published in expo so you can go to this link:
